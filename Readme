Ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water is vital for public health and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict water potability by analyzing key water quality parameters.

 Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that classifies water samples as potable (safe to drink) or non-potable based on physicochemical properties. By analyzing parameters such as pH, hardness, and total dissolved solids (TDS), the model aims to provide a reliable assessment of water quality.

 Features

- Analysis of Water Quality Parameters: The model considers various indicators, including pH, hardness, TDS, chloramines, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes (THMs), and turbidity.

- Supervised Machine Learning: Employs algorithms for binary classification to determine water potability.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts EDA to uncover data trends and patterns, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dataset.

- Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robustness.

- User-Friendly Implementation: Provides scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and testing, enabling straightforward replication and adaptation.

 Dataset

The dataset comprises water quality metrics with a target column indicating potability (1 for potable, 0 for non-potable). Key features include:

- pH: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of water.

- Hardness: Indicates the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions.

- Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Represents the total concentration of dissolved substances in water.

- Chloramines: Levels of chloramines used for disinfection.

- Conductivity: Waterâ€™s ability to conduct electrical current, related to ion concentration.

- Organic Carbon: Amount of organic compounds present in water.

- Trihalomethanes (THMs): Byproducts formed during water chlorination.

- Turbidity Clarity of water, with higher values indicating more particles.
